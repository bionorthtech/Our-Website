  Parkinson's disease and restores movement with precision neuromuscular stimulation we devleloped.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds the site and publishes
it to GitHub Pages at `https://bionorthtech.github.io/BioNorth-Main/`.

**One-time setup:** in repo **Settings → Pages**, set **Source = "GitHub Actions"**.

### Custom domain (bionorth.us)

To serve from `bionorth.us` instead of the project path:

1. Set `base: "/"` in `vite.config.js`.
2. Add `public/CNAME` containing `bionorth.us`.
3. Configure the domain's DNS and the custom domain in Settings → Pages.
